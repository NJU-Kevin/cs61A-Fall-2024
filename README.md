# cs61A

## Introduction

This repository is for recording my version of codes in `cs61A Fall 2024` course, which is a course on Python programming at UC Berkeley. The course covers the basics of Python programming, including data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. The course also includes several projects that require students to apply their knowledge of Python to solve subproblems and realize some functions. We only need to complete the core codes for the homwworks and projects, and the course will provide us with the test cases to verify our codes using `ok`.

## Description

In this repository, I've pushed the entire directory of each homework, lab and project, including the directories provided for tests. For any part, my version of code is the python file with the same name as the directory, i.e. `directory_name.py`, and I don't modify any test files or supporting files.

The codes in this repository have all passed the `ok` tests provided by the course. Since I've never referenced the solutions online by other users, the codes might not be the most efficient or elegant, but they are functional and meet the requirements of the course. Moreover, the `EC` (Extra Credit) parts of the projects are also included in this repository, some of which are a little bit challenging for beginners. However, some diy parts, such as `final_diff` function in `cats/cats.py` and `final_strategy` in `hog/hog.py`, are simple copies of functions previously in the files, which I think, however, are interesting problems and worth consideration in the future.

## Update

This is not an ultimate version of the codes, and I will update it as I progress through the course.
